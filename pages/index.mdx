# UVA Degree Plan Templates + Google Sheets Addon

> If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
> - Dr. Susan Caffery

Planning is unreasonably effective[^1]. Though you may not follow your plan exactly, the act of working through and processing the steps is a wildly beneficial exercise. The issue is **I hate the Student Information System (SIS)** degree planner.

- It's slow
- It's clunky
- It's hard to use
- It's hard to read
- It's hard to share

A plain spreadsheet is so much easier, versatile and faster to use. 

## What is this project?

This project contains two things: 
- **a collection of degree planning templates**
- **a Google Sheets Addon** that automatically populates the templates with your course information.

<Steps>
### Clone the template

Pull all relevant course information. No more errors in translation. Everything else populates.

### Add the API to your site

If starting from scratch is more your style, [add the Addon to your Google Sheet here](). Check out the [Addon Reference](./reference.mdx) for what the addon can do.

### Only touch `Course Number` and `GPA`

Everything else can be automatically populated. Quite literally the fastest course planning experience you'll ever have.
