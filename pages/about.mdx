# About

My name is William Kaiser, and I am a second-year Computer Science Student at the University of Virginia. I have some medicore javascript skills and got inspired by [UVA's SIS API Published by Prof. Mark Sherriff for CS 3130](https://s23.cs3240.org/sis-api.html). 

## How it works? 

As many a UVA student will know, the Student Information System (SIS) sucks. As you can imagine, SIS's internal API is cut from the same cloth.

For this reason, I had to supplement this with a UVA Developer API I found.

The separation of concerns is:
- [SIS API](https://s23.cs3240.org/sis-api.html) only gets the number of credit hours
- [UVA Developer API](https://api.devhub.virginia.edu/v1/courses) fetches a list of courses 

## Google Sheets Connector

Like all good things, it starts with a `fetch` call. However, to be a Google Sheet's extension, a [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) handles each function call.

As SIS does not allow external requests, a Firestore database caches credit information, something I have to manually update each semester.

## Future Plans?

This was my first attempt at building a tool for the UVA community. However, someone is surely going to have some seemingly obvious idea for future expansion that I simply missed. **Please tell me!** Shoot me an email, submit a feature request on GitHub.
