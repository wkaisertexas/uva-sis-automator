    UVA SIS Automator + Degree Plan Templates
</h1>

Automate both the process of building and getting data for you degree plan at the University of Virginia (UVA). Planning is great, but UVA's [student information system](https://in.virginia.edu/sis) planning features are quite terrible.

This project creates:
- **a Google Sheets Add-On** to pull course information (e.g. title, instructors, units, etc.) from a course pneumonic (e.g. CS 2100, PSYC 1020, etc.)
- **templates for common degree plans** built with connectors
> Currently, only B.S. Computer Science, but planning to expand
